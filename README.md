# Less Of A Mess

### Fixes:
1. Fix minor already choosen
2. Fix missing profile
3. ~~control r doesn't reset major~~
4. ~~Now control r reset but leider sometimes loads something else~~
5. Reset doesn't remove error frame 'same minor' (see 1.)

## To Do:

1. Make update the csv work (done major) --Minor to do--
2. ~~Get an idea for absolut path not going to 'pycharm projects'~~
3. Do a separation between Pflicht and wahl thanks to a frame
4. Allow to show modules pro semesters (multi choice optionmenu)
5. can check Studien- and Pr√ºfungleistung independantly, even with modules with several Studienleistung
6. can put a marker on wahlpflicht to note what is intended to do (the user choice so far)
7. a bulle for the leistungspunkte typ or something
8. Use OS to make absolute path
